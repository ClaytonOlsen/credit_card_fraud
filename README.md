It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. In this project we aim to classify credit card purchases based on credit card purchase data found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). 

## Data Overview

The credit card fraud dataset contains post principal component analysis variables to maintain anonimity as well as the amount paid for each purchase, the time, and the response variable the class (1 for fraduelent and 0 for non-fradulent).
